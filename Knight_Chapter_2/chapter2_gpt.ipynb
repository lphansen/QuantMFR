    "# 2 Stationary Increments\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithms of many economic time series that appear to display stochastic growth can be modeled as having stationary increments. Multivariate versions of these models possess stochastic process versions of balanced growth paths. Applied econometricians seek permanent shocks that contribute to such growth. Furthermore, we shall see that it is convenient to pose central limit theory in terms of processes with stationary increments. The mathematical formulation in this chapter opens the door to studying these topics."
