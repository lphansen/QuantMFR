    "When $\\operatorname{Pr}$ is measure preserving and the process $\\left\\{X_t: t=0,1, \\ldots\\right\\}$ is stationary, it can be useful to invent an infinite past. To accomplish this, we reason in terms of the (measurable) transformation $\\mathbb{S}: \\Omega \\rightarrow \\Omega$ that describes the evolution of a sample point $\\omega$. Until now we have assumed that $\\mathbb{S}$ has the property that for any event $\\Lambda \\in \\mathfrak{F}$,\n",

    "Remark 1.10.2. Almost a century ago, both Slutsky (192'7) and Yule (1927) used probability models to analyze economic time series. Their models implied moving-average representations like the one in Example 1.10.1. Their idea was to see economic time series as responding linearly to current and past independent and identically distributed impulses or shocks. In distinct contributions, they showed how such models generate recurrent but aperiodic fluctuations that resemble business cycles and longer-term cycles as well. Yule and Slutsky came from different backgrounds and brought different perspectives. Yule was an eminent statistician who, among other important contributions, managed \"effectively to invent modern time series analysis\" in the words of Stigler (1986). Yule constructed and estimated what we would now call a second-order autoregression and applied it to study sunspots. Yule's estimates implied $\\alpha_j$ coefficients showed damped oscillations at the same periodicity as sunspots. In Russia in the 1920s, Slutsky wrote a seminal paper in Russian motivated by his interest in business cycles. Only later was an English version of his paper published Econometrica. Even before that, it was already on the radar screen of economists including Ragnar Frisch. Indeed, Frisch was keenly aware of both Slutsky (192'7) and Yule (1927) and generously acknowledged both of them in his seminal paper Frisch (1933) on the impulse and propagation problem. Building on insights of Slutsky and Yule, Frisch pioneered impulse response functions. His ambition was to provide explicit economic interpretations for how shocks alter economic time series both now and later. ${ }^{14}$"
