    "We start with a probability space, namely, a triple $(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F}, \\operatorname{Pr})$, where $\\mathfrak{F}$ is a collection of events (a sigma algebra) and $\\operatorname{Pr}$ assigns probabilities to events. The following definition makes reference to Borel sets. Borel sets include open sets, closed sets, finite intersections, and countable unions of such sets.\n",

    "By changing the set $\\mathfrak{b}$, we trace out a probability distribution implied by the random vector $X$ that is called the induced distribution. An induced distribution is what typically interests an applied worker. In practice, an induced distribution is just specified directly without constructing the foundations under study here. However, proceeding at a deeper level as we have by defining a random vector to be a function that satisfies particular measurable properties and imposing the probability measure $\\mathrm{Pr}$ over the domain of that function has mathematical payoffs that we will exploit in various ways, among them being in construction of stochastic processes.\n",

This insight extends to the study of stochastic processes. Thus, the following way to construct a probability space is particularly enlightening.\n",

    "Construction 1.2.3. Let $\\Omega$ be a collection of infinite sequences in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with an element $\\omega \\in \\Omega$ being a sequence of vectors $\\omega=\\left(\\mathbf{r}_0, \\mathbf{r}_1, \\ldots\\right)$, where $\\mathbf{r}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. To construct $\\mathfrak{F}$, proceed as follows. Let $\\mathfrak{B}$ be the collection of Borel sets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{F}}$ denote the collection of all subsets $\\Lambda$ of $\\Omega$ that can be represented in the following way.

    "Next we construct a measure that assigns probabilities to events in $\\mathfrak{F}$. For each integer $\\ell \\geq 0$, let $\\operatorname{Pr}_{\\ell}$ assign probabilities to the Borel sets of $\\mathbb{R}^{n(\\ell+1)}$. A Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}^{n(\\ell+1)}$ can also be viewed as a Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}^{n(\\ell+2)}$ with $\\mathbf{r}_{n(\\ell+1)}$ left unrestricted.

In this sense, the outcome of the Law of Large Numbers under an iid sequence determines what we will call a statistical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, an iid version of the Law of Large Numbers is too restrictive. First, we are interested in economic dynamics in which model outcomes are temporally dependent. Second, we want to put ourselves in the situation of a statistician who does not know a priori what the underlying data generating process is and therefore entertains multiple models. We will present a Law of Large Numbers that covers both settings."
