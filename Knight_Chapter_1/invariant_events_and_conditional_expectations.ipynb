    "We use the concept of an invariant event to understand how limit points of time series averages relate to a conditional mathematical expectation.\n",
    "Definition 1.5.1. An event $\\Lambda$ is invariant if $\\Lambda=\\mathbb{S}^{-1}(\\Lambda)$.\n",
    "Figure 1.3 illustrates two invariant events in a space $\\Omega$. Notice that if $\\Lambda$ is an invariant event and $\\omega \\in \\Lambda$, then $\\mathbb{S}^t(\\omega) \\in \\Lambda$ for $t=0,1, \\ldots, \\infty$.\n",

    "Let $\\mathfrak{I}$ denote the collection of invariant events. The entire space $\\Omega$ and the null set $\\varnothing$ are both invariant events. Like $\\mathfrak{F}$, the collection of invariant events $\\mathfrak{I}$ is a sigma algebra.\n",

    "We want to construct a random vector $E(X \\mid \\mathfrak{I})$ called the \"mathematical expectation of $X$ conditional on the collection $\\mathfrak{J}$ of invariant events\". We begin with a situation in which a conditional expectation is a discrete random vector as occurs when invariant events are unions of sets $\\Lambda_j$ belonging to a countable partition of $\\Omega$ (together with the empty set). Later we'll extend the definition beyond this special setting.\n",

    "A countable partition consists of a countable collection of nonempty events $\\Lambda_j$ such that $\\Lambda_j \\cap \\Lambda_k=\\varnothing$ for $j \\neq k$ and such that the union of all $\\Lambda_j$ is $\\Omega$. Assume that each set $\\Lambda_j$ in the partition is itself an invariant event. Define the mathematical expectation conditioned on event $\\Lambda_j$ as\n",

    "Thus, the conditional expectation $E(X \\mid \\mathfrak{I})$ is constant for $\\omega \\in \\Lambda_j$ but varies across $\\Lambda_j$ 's. Figure 1.4 illustrates this characterization for a finite partition.\n",

    "Now let $X$ be a random vector with finite second moments $E X X^{\\prime}=$ $\\int X(\\omega) X(\\omega)^{\\prime} d \\operatorname{Pr}(\\omega)$. When a random vector $X$ has finite second moments, a conditional expectation is a least squares projection.

In the special case in which the invariant events can be constructed from a finite partition, $Z$ can vary across sets $\\Lambda_j$ but must remain constant within $\\Lambda_j$. . Consider the least squares problem\n",
