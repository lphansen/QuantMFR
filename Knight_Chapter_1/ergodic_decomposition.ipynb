    "Up to now, we have represented invariant events with a countable partition. Dynkin (1978) deduced a more general version of decomposition (1.4) without assuming a countable partition. Thus, start with a pair $(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F})$. Also, assume that there is a metric on $\\Omega$ and that $\\Omega$ is separable. We also assume that $\\mathfrak{F}$ is the collection of Borel sets (the smallest sigma algebra containing the open sets). Given $(\\Omega, \\mathfrak{F})$, take a (measurable) transformation $\\mathbb{S}$ and consider the set $\\mathcal{P}$ of probability measures $\\operatorname{Pr}$ for which $\\mathbb{S}$ is measurepreserving. For some of these probability measures, $\\mathbb{S}$ is ergodic, but for others, it is not. Let $\\mathcal{Q}$ denote the set of probability measures for which $\\mathbb{S}$ is ergodic. Under a nondegenerate convex combination of two probability measures in $\\mathcal{Q}, \\mathbb{S}$ is measure-preserving but not ergodic. Dynkin (1978) constructed limiting empirical measures $Q r$ on $\\mathcal{Q}$ and justified the following representation of the set $\\mathcal{P}$ of probability measures $\\operatorname{Pr}$.\n",

    "Proposition 1.8.1 generalizes representation (1.4). It asserts a sense in which the set $\\mathcal{P}$ of probabilities for which $\\mathbb{S}$ is measure-preserving is convex. Extremal points of this set are in the smaller set $\\mathcal{Q}$ of probability measures for which the transformation $\\mathbb{S}$ is ergodic. Representation (1.5) shows that by forming \"mixtures\" (i.e., weighted averages or convex combinations) of probability measures under which $\\mathbb{S}$ is ergodic, we can represent all probability specifications for which $\\mathbb{S}$ is measure-preserving.\n",

    "To add another perspective, a collection of invariant events $\\mathfrak{I}$ is associated with a transformation $\\mathbb{S}$. There exists a common conditional expectation operator $\\mathbb{J} \\equiv E(\\cdot \\mid \\mathfrak{I})$ that assigns mathematical expectations to bounded measurable functions (mapping $\\Omega$ into $\\mathbb{R}$ ) conditioned on the set of invariant events $\\mathfrak{I}$. The conditional expectation operator $\\mathbb{J}$ characterizes limit points of time series averages of indicator functions of events of interest as well as other random vectors. Alternative probability measures $\\mathrm{Pr}$ assign different probabilities to the invariant events."
