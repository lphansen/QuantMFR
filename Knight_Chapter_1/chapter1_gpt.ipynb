    "A probabilistic form of invariance gives rise to a Law of Large Numbers. The invariance notion is a stochastic counterpart to a steady state of a dynamic economic model. The Law of Large Numbers conditions on a set of special events called *invariant events* that we can interpret as indexing alternative possible statistical models. These ideas allow us to characterize what can be learned from time series evidence and what must originate elsewhere."

    "**Remark 1.10.2** Almost a century ago, both [Slutsky (1927)](#slutsky:1927) and [Yule (1927)](#yule:1927) used probability models to analyze economic time series. Their models implied moving-average representations like the one in [Example 1.10.1](#ex:MA). Their idea was to see economic time series as responding linearly to current and past independent and identically distributed impulses or shocks. In distinct contributions, they showed how such models generate recurrent but aperiodic fluctuations that resemble business cycles and longer-term cycles as well. Yule and Slutsky came from different backgrounds and brought different perspectives. Yule was an eminent statistician who, among other important contributions, managed \"effectively to invent modern time series analysis\" in the words of [Stigler (1986)](#stigler:1986). Yule constructed and estimated what we would now call a second-order autoregression and applied it to study sunspots. Yule's estimates implied $\\alpha_j$ coefficients showed damped oscillations at the same periodicity as sunspots. In Russia in the 1920s, Slutsky wrote a seminal paper in Russian motivated by his interest in business cycles. Only later was an English version of his paper published *Econometrica*. Even before that, it was already on the radar screen of economists including Ragnar Frisch. Indeed, Frisch was keenly aware of both [Slutsky (1927)](#slutsky:1927) and [Yule (1927)](#yule:1927) and generously acknowledged both of them in his seminal paper [Frisch (1993)](#frisch:1933) on the impulse and propagation problem. Building on insights of Slutsky and Yule, Frisch pioneered impulse response functions. His ambition was to provide explicit economic interpretations for how shocks alter economic time series both now and later.[^14]\n",

    "For a fixed $\\mathbb{S}$ there are often many possible probabilities $Pr$ that are measure preserving. A subset of these are ergodic. These ergodic probabilities can serve as building blocks for the other measure preserving probabilities. Thus, each measure preserving $Pr$ can be expressed as a weighted average of the ergodic probabilities. We call the ergodic probabilities statistical models. The Law of Large of Numbers applies to each of the ergodic building blocks with limit points that are unconditional expectations. As embodied in <a id=\"countdecompose\"></a>[1](#countdecompose) and its generalization <a id=\"dynkin\"></a>[2](#dynkin), this decomposition interests both frequentist and Bayesian statisticians."
