We live in a world filled with uncertainty. In this essay, I show that featuring this phenomenon
more in economic analyses adds to our understanding of how financial markets work and how
best to design prudent economic policy. This essay explores methods that allow for a broader
conceptualization of uncertainty than is typical in economic investigations. These methods draw
on insights from decision theory to engage in uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis.
Uncertainty quantification in economics differs from most sciences because there is uncertainty
both from the perspective of an external observer and from people and enterprises within the
model. I illustrate these methods in two example economies in which the understanding of
long-term growth is limited. One example looks at uncertainty ramifications for fluctuations in
financial markets, and the other considers the prudent design of policy when the quantitative
magnitude of climate change and its impact on economic opportunities is unknown.
