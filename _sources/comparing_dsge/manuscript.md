We compare and contrast production economies exposed to long-run uncertainty with investors that have  possibly different preferences and/or access to financial markets. We study the macroeconomic and asset pricing properties of these models, identify common features and highlight areas where these models depart from each other. Our framework allows us to investigate more fully the  impact of  investor heterogeneity, capital heterogeneity, and fluctuations of the growth components to the capital evolution as they  affect the dynamics of macroeconomic quantities and asset prices. In our comparisons, we employ an array of diagnostic tools to explore time-variation and state-dependencies in  nonlinear environments.
