    "# 4.2 Extracting Martingales\n",
    "\n",
    "We can decompose an additive functional into a sum of components, one of which is an additive martingale that encapsulates all long-run stochastic variation as in Proposition 2.2.2. In this section, we show how to extract the martingale component. We adopt a construction like that used to establish Proposition 2.2 .2 and proceed in four steps.\n",

We use a Proposition 4.2.1 decomposition as a way to associate a \"permanent shock\" with an additive functional. The permanent shock is the increment to the martingale.\n"
